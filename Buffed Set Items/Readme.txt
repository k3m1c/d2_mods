Installation Instructions:
1. Download D2RMM from nexus mods. Search for D2RMM Mod Manager on nexus mods at the top search bar.
2. Unzip BuffedSetItems.zip and place contents of mods folder inside the mods folder in D2RMM.
3. Directory structure should be D2RMM 1.5\mods
4. Add D2R installation folder file directory where you installed D2R usually found in C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II Resurrected to the (Settings tab) in D2RMM Found at the top of the app. ***This step is very important if you don't properly setup the File directory in Settings you will get an error.***
5. Checkmark the mod on the left side with the square box.
6. When done click on Install Mods at bottom of D2RMM app, *wait* a moment until a green pop up shows you've installed the mod.
7. Click on Run D2R inside D2RMM app at bottom of screen to launch the game.

***Instead of Launching the Mod Pack directly through D2RMM You can instead create a shortcut of D2R.exe located in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II Resurrected\D2R.exe" and right click D2R.exe and select Properties. Inside the Target label where it says "C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II Resurrected\D2R.exe" add this line to it -mod D2RMM -txt so it looks like this (see below) and hit Apply to save the shortcut. Now all you have to do is click the D2R.exe Shortcut you just made to Launch the Mod Pack without having to Launch D2RMM. 
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II Resurrected\D2R.exe" -mod D2RMM -txt
